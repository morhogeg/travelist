## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**App:** Travelist AI — iOS travel places curation app
**Path:** `/Users/morhogeg/travelist-2`
**Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Capacitor 7 (iOS)
**Backend:** Firebase (Firestore + Auth, JS SDK)
**AI:** Google Gemini 3 Flash via Firebase Cloud Function proxy (`functions/src/index.ts`). Client calls `https://us-central1-travelistai-production.cloudfunctions.net/callGeminiProxy` — API key never touches the client.
**Design:** "iOS 26 Liquid Glass" glassmorphism — purple gradient (#667eea → #764ba2). Zero #007AFF.
**Bundle ID:** `com.travelist.app` | **App Name:** `Travelist AI`
**iOS min:** 15.0 | Capacitor 7.4.4
**TestFlight:** Build 1.0 (1) live, internal group "Mor's Team" — uploaded Jan 9, 2026
**Privacy policy:** https://morhogeg.github.io/travelist/PRIVACY_POLICY
**Firebase project:** `travelistai-production`

### Key npm scripts
```bash
npm run dev              # Web preview on localhost:5173
npm run build            # Dev build
npm run build:prod       # Production build
npx cap sync ios         # Sync web assets to iOS
npx cap open ios         # Open Xcode
npm run ios:dev          # build + sync + open Xcode
```

### Architecture at a glance
- `src/pages/` — 12 pages: Index (home), Inbox, TripDetailPage, Profile, Settings, etc.
- `src/services/ai/` — Gemini client (proxy-based), AI cache (Firestore, 30-day TTL)
- `functions/src/index.ts` — Firebase Cloud Function proxy for Gemini API (key in Firebase Secrets)
- `src/services/proximity/` — Background location + local notifications
- `src/utils/recommendation/` — localStorage CRUD for places
- `src/utils/inbox/` — Share Extension inbox store
- `ios/App/ShareExtension/` — Native Swift Share Extension (fully implemented)
- App Groups: `group.com.travelist.shared` — used to pass data between Share Extension and main app

### Firebase setup
- **Project:** `travelistai-production`
- **Web app ID:** `1:628341208308:web:fc7a9a90e6b881a5975aa1`
- **Functions:** Node 20, region `us-central1`, Blaze plan
- **Secrets:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` stored in Firebase Secret Manager (not in any file)
- **Firestore rules:** require `request.auth != null` on all collections
- **Firebase config:** in `.env` (not committed) — copy from `.env.example`

---

## WHAT WAS DONE

### Session 1 — App Store readiness + code audit
1. **Apple Sign-In button removed** — `src/components/onboarding/screens/SignInScreen.tsx`
   - Was a dummy (just called `onNext()`), risking App Store rejection
   - Screen now shows informational content + "Continue without account" only

2. **Production console.log cleanup** — `src/lib/firebase.ts`
   - `console.warn` calls now guarded with `if (import.meta.env.DEV)`

3. **App Store listing content written** — ready to paste into App Store Connect (see section below)

### Session 7 — Proximity alerts full rewrite (March 8, 2026)
Proximity feature was completely non-functional. 8 bugs fixed across 6 files. New `useProximityMonitor` hook created.

**Root causes fixed:**
- `startProximityMonitoring` was imported but never called — GPS watch never started
- Places had no coordinates; geocode functions were defined but never called from the app
- `enabledCityIds: []` default → zero places ever monitored; auto-enable all cities on first start
- `enableHighAccuracy: false` + 100m accuracy cap → most iOS positions silently dropped
- `notifiedPlaceIds: string[]` stored permanently → users never re-notified after first visit; replaced with 24h timestamp cooldown
- Notification `schedule: { at: new Date() }` fired in the past → changed to `+500ms`
- City-center geocode fallback caused false notifications → removed; places not in OSM are skipped
- Monitoring died on app relaunch; `useProximityMonitor` in App.tsx now restarts on mount

**Key files changed:**
- `src/hooks/native/useProximityMonitor.ts` — **NEW** — app-level lifecycle hook (mount → start, settings change → restart, data change → update places). Geocodes uncached places in background at 1/sec.
- `src/services/proximity/proximity-service.ts` — `enableHighAccuracy: true`, accuracy threshold 300m, notification `+500ms`
- `src/services/proximity/geocoding-service.ts` — persistent localStorage geocode cache (`travelist-geocode-cache`), exports `getCachedCoords`
- `src/utils/proximity/proximity-settings.ts` — `notifiedPlaces: Record<string, number>` (timestamp-based 24h cooldown), migration from old format
- `src/hooks/native/useProximity.ts` — removed dead `startProximityMonitoring` import; settings changes fire `proximitySettingsChanged` which `useProximityMonitor` listens to
- `src/App.tsx` — added `useProximityMonitor()` call

**iOS side confirmed correct:** `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` + `UIBackgroundModes: location` both present in Info.plist. Background monitoring should work; iOS will auto-prompt for "Always" upgrade when app backgrounds.

**Known limitation:** Nominatim only finds places listed in OpenStreetMap. Well-known restaurants/hotels/attractions → geocoded. Very local/obscure places → skipped silently.

---

### Session 6 — Travel Story redesign (March 8, 2026)
Full visual redesign of the Travel Story page. All card components rewritten.

**Changes:**
- `StatsHeroCard`: 68px hero number as focal point, radial glow, clean stat trio with hairline dividers, large plain flag emoji, refined progress ring, bottom watermark strip
- `SourceBreakdown`: unified card with relative bars per recommender, consistent small-caps label ("WHO INSPIRES YOU"), no emoji header
- `CategoryChart`: ghost+solid dual-tone bars per category, legend in ruled footer, consistent label ("WHAT YOU LOVE")
- `DiscoveryTimeline`: removed redundant month pills scroll, editorial month headers (`MARCH 2026 · 3 places`), minimal row entries inside card, integrated expand/collapse
- `TravelStory.tsx`: tightened section spacing (`mb-3`), removed redundant page title (hero card owns it)

---

### Session 5 — Settings tab redesign (March 4, 2026)
Full redesign of the Settings tab. All changes in `src/pages/Settings.tsx` and `src/components/settings/`.

**Structural changes:**
- Grouped settings into labeled iOS-style sections: Appearance / Location & Alerts / Navigation / Intelligence & Privacy / Account
- Fixed double-separator bug and removed unused `ShareExtensionGuide` import

**Visual/dark mode overhaul:**
- Replaced `liquid-glass-clear` cards (heavy white border in dark mode) with `bg-neutral-100/80 dark:bg-transparent dark:ring-1 dark:ring-white/[0.08]` — transparent glass frames in dark mode, no grey fill
- Reverted to app's original black background (removed `#111113` override that caused inconsistency with rest of app)

**Icon system:**
- `SettingsRow` updated: every icon now sits in a coloured rounded square (iOS 18 style), `iconColor` prop controls the tint
- Colours chosen semantically: orange (theme), green (proximity), red (navigation), purple (AI), green (cloud), red (delete)

**Component redesigns:**
- `AISettings` — removed nested card-within-card. Model status and Privacy & Data are proper list rows with RowDividers. Privacy row has ChevronRight arrow.
- `AuthSettings` — completely redesigned as a collapsible accordion. Shows a single clean row by default; tapping it animates open the sign-in form (`AnimatePresence` height transition). Signed-in state shows just email + Sign Out in one row.
- `NavigationSettings` — fixed selected-state colour from `text-accent` (orange) to `bg-[#667eea]/15 text-[#667eea]` (app purple)
- `DeleteAccountSettings` — converted from "row + separate button" to a single tappable row with ChevronRight that opens the confirmation dialog

---

### Session 4 — New-user UX review + fixes (March 4, 2026)
Full new-user review conducted, 7 fixes shipped to `main` (commit `7c5c4a3`).

**Onboarding overhaul**
- Cut from 8 → 6 screens: removed `ProximityAlertsScreen` and `NavigateScreen`
- Replaced broken Apple Sign-In screen (dummy button + "cloud sync coming soon") with a celebratory "You're all set." completion screen (`SignInScreen.tsx`)
- Full visual redesign of all 5 onboarding screens — cleaner, on-brand, more useful:
  - `ProblemScreen`: stacked chaos-card pile (Screenshot / DM / Saved) instead of XCircle
  - `WelcomeScreen`: gradient T logo with shimmer, gradient headline, 3 animated feature pills
  - `ShareToSaveScreen`: numbered 3-step flow with gradient step numbers
  - `AIMagicScreen`: live input → parsed card demo matching actual app UI (amber tip, MapPin, source)
  - `GestureTutorialScreen`: cleaner swipe labels, refined result state cards

**Add drawer**
- AI free-text tab moved to the left (it's the default) — `RecommendationDrawer.tsx`
- Structured input tab moved to the right

**Navigation**
- "Inbox" renamed to "Shared" in bottom nav and page title — `Navbar.tsx`, `Inbox.tsx`
- Inbox empty state rewritten to explain the iOS Share Sheet workflow

**Profile**
- Welcome card for new users with 0 places: "Welcome, explorer!" + "Add your first place" CTA — `Profile.tsx`

**Home**
- One-time first-launch tooltip above the + FAB: "Tap + to save a place you heard about" — `Index.tsx`
- Dismissed on any tap, never shown again (`travelist-fab-hint-shown` localStorage flag)

---

### Session 3 — Security hardening round 2
8. **"Get info" rate limiting** ✅
   - 30-minute cooldown per place stored in `localStorage` (`ai_cooldown_<placeId>`)
   - Button disabled with "Info refreshes in Xm" label during cooldown
   - Cooldown only written on success — errors allow retry
   - File: `src/components/home/RecommendationDetailsDialog.tsx`

9. **`ai_cache` write-protected** ✅ CRITICAL FIX
   - Cache writes moved from client → Cloud Function (Admin SDK, bypasses rules)
   - Client-side `cacheAISummary` removed from `ai-cache-service.ts`
   - `gemini-client.ts` now sends `cacheContext` in proxy request body
   - `firestore.rules` created: `ai_cache` is read-only for clients (`allow write: if false`)
   - Deployed: `firebase deploy --only functions && firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

10. **.env git tracking verified** ✅
    - File is untracked (good). Was committed in 3 old commits (`Initial commit`, `Improve AI suggestions caching`, `fix(security): prevent API key leaks`) but all keys are rotated.
    - If repo ever goes public, run BFG Repo-Cleaner to purge history.

### Session 2 — Security hardening
4. **Gemini API key secured** ✅ CRITICAL FIX
   - Old key `AIzaSyCe4dodNptsQPS3QfK8V0IvS58B8A9qWGo` was in bundle — **rotated and invalidated**
   - New key stored in Firebase Secret Manager only (`firebase functions:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY`)
   - Client now calls a Firebase Cloud Function proxy via plain `fetch()` — no key in bundle
   - Switched from `onCall` (callable) to `onRequest` (HTTP) — callable SDK was silently failing in Capacitor WKWebView

5. **OpenRouter removed entirely** ✅
   - `src/services/ai/openrouter-client.ts` deleted
   - All imports and references cleaned up across the codebase
   - Gemini is the sole AI provider

6. **Firebase web app registered** — required for JS SDK initialization in Capacitor
   - App ID: `1:628341208308:web:fc7a9a90e6b881a5975aa1`
   - Firebase config vars added to `.env`

7. **Firestore rules verified** — `allow read, write: if request.auth != null` on all collections (confirmed in Firebase Console)

## CODE REVIEW FINDINGS

### CRITICAL — Must fix before App Store submission

**[C1] Location permission never requested during onboarding** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- `src/components/onboarding/screens/ProximityAlertsScreen.tsx` calls `Geolocation.requestPermissions()` when user taps "Continue". No fix needed.

---

### HIGH — Fix before or immediately after launch

**[H1] Duplicate place submission possible** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- `StructuredInputForm.tsx` and `FreeTextForm.tsx` both have `disabled={isAnalyzing}` with spinners. `isLoading` from `useRecommendationSubmit` is threaded down as `isAnalyzing`. No fix needed.

**[H2] GPS accuracy not validated before proximity trigger** ✅ FIXED (Mar 3, 2026)
- File: `src/services/proximity/proximity-service.ts`
- Threshold is now `Math.min(settings.distanceMeters * 0.5, 100)` — caps at 100m so large alert radii can't let bad GPS readings slip through. Debug log updated to show measured vs threshold values.

**[H3] Firestore sync failures silent in production**
- File: `src/utils/recommendation/recommendation-manager.ts:121–125`
- Sync errors are swallowed silently. When cloud sync ships, users could silently lose data.
- **Fix:** Write a flag to localStorage on failure and surface a subtle "Sync paused" indicator.

---

### MEDIUM — Good to fix before next release

**[M1] Onboarding proximity toggle removed** ✅ RESOLVED (Mar 4)
- `ProximityAlertsScreen` removed from onboarding entirely (was non-functional). Proximity alerts are discoverable via Settings.

**[M2] City name fragmentation**
- "Tel Aviv" and "tel aviv" and "Tel-Aviv" are stored as separate cities. No normalization.
- **Fix:** `.trim()` and title-case normalization on city/country when saving.

**[M3] Trip suggestions have no images**
- AI-suggested places in `TripDetailPage.tsx` show placeholder images.

**[M4] No "saved offline" feedback**
- Adding a place with no internet gives no confirmation.

**[M5] No crash reporting**
- No Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry.
- **Fix:** Add `@capacitor-firebase/crashlytics` — 30-minute integration.

---

### LOW

**[L1] Performance** — `groupedRecommendations` recalculated on every filter change.

**[L2] Accessibility** — Several icon buttons lack `aria-label`.

**[L3] Token limit hardcoded** — `maxOutputTokens: 1000` in `gemini-client.ts` can truncate longer AI descriptions.

---

## SECURITY STATUS

### Resolved ✅
- **[S-CRIT-1] Gemini API key** — rotated + moved to Firebase Secrets. Client never sees the key.
- **[S-CRIT-2] OpenRouter** — removed entirely. No client-side AI keys remain.
- **[S-HIGH-1] Firestore rules** — verified: `request.auth != null` on all collections.

### Remaining

**[S-MED-1] No rate limiting on AI calls** ✅ FIXED — 30-min client-side cooldown per place in `RecommendationDetailsDialog.tsx`.

**[S-MED-2] Proxy has no auth check** — anyone who discovers the Cloud Function URL can invoke it.
- Blocked by: real auth not implemented yet (Apple Sign-In is dummy).
- **Fix (when auth is real):** Add `if (!request.auth) throw HttpsError('unauthenticated')` to the function.

**[S-MED-3] ai_cache writable by any authenticated user** ✅ FIXED — writes moved to Cloud Function (Admin SDK). Firestore rules deny all client writes to `ai_cache`.

**[S-MED-4] localStorage data unencrypted at rest** — readable on jailbroken device. Acceptable for v1.

**[S-LOW-1] No email verification before account creation**

**[S-LOW-2] No crash reporting** — flying blind in production.

## PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN

### 🔜 Next session
| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 0 | **Fix TestFlight bugs** | User tested on physical device — list of bugs to come |

### Before App Store submission
| # | Task | File(s) | Status |

| 1 | Fix TestFlight bugs from physical device | TBD | ❌ Next session |
| 2 | Increment build number in Xcode | Xcode project settings | ❌ TODO (still Build 1) |
| 3 | Take App Store screenshots in Simulator | `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot <path>.png` | ❌ TODO |
| 4 | Paste App Store listing content into App Store Connect | App Store Connect | ❌ TODO |
| 5 | Complete age rating questionnaire (answer: 4+) | App Store Connect | ❌ TODO |

### Before App Store submission
| # | Task | File(s) | Status |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 6 | Take screenshots in Simulator (manual) | iOS Simulator | ❌ TODO |
| 7 | Add GPS accuracy check to proximity trigger | `proximity-service.ts` | ✅ Fixed Mar 3 |
| 8 | Add debounce on "Get info" button (rate limiting) | `RecommendationDetailsDialog.tsx` | ✅ Fixed Mar 3 |

| 10 | Add Firebase Crashlytics | `@capacitor-firebase/crashlytics` |
| 11 | City name normalization on save | trim + title-case |
| 12 | Offline save feedback | "Saved locally" toast |
| 13 | Sync failure indicator | when cloud sync ships |
| 14 | ~~Restrict ai_cache writes in Firestore rules~~ | ✅ Fixed Mar 3 — writes moved to Cloud Function |

### ⚠️ BEFORE ENABLING CLOUD SYNC — CRITICAL
**[SYNC-BLOCK] Firestore rules are not user-scoped**
- Current rules: `allow read, write: if request.auth != null` — any logged-in user can read ANY document in ANY collection
- Required before sync: `allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId`
- User data (places, collections, routes) must include a `userId` field on every document
- Without this fix, cloud sync = all users can see each other's data
- `ai_cache` is intentionally global (shared cache) — keep its rules separate

---

## NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

### 🎯 Priority: Fix bugs found on physical device (TestFlight)
User tested on physical iPhone via TestFlight and found bugs to report. Start next session by asking the user to list them — fix each one, then rebuild and sync.

**Build workflow reminder:** `npm run build:prod && npx cap sync ios` → Run/Archive in Xcode

### Proximity — things to verify on device
- Toggle proximity ON in Settings → should request location permission
- App backgrounded → iOS should prompt to upgrade to "Always Allow"
- Walk near a saved place (or simulate in Xcode: Debug → Simulate Location) → notification should fire
- Notification tap → opens place card in app
- Same place: no second notification until 24h later
- Geocoding: check console logs (`[ProximityMonitor]`, `[ProximityService]`, `[Geocoding]`) for progress

### Settings tab — current state (as of Session 5)
Fully redesigned. Key files:
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` — page layout, section grouping
- `src/components/settings/SettingsRow.tsx` — rounded-square icon system
- `src/components/settings/AuthSettings.tsx` — collapsible accordion sign-in
- `src/components/settings/AISettings.tsx` — flat row list (no nested cards)
- `src/components/settings/NavigationSettings.tsx` — purple selected state
- `src/components/settings/DeleteAccountSettings.tsx` — tappable row → AlertDialog

**Known remaining consideration:** The proximity section (distance slider + city manager) still expands inline inside the card. Could be moved to a dedicated sub-page if it grows more complex.

---

- **AI proxy:** Cloud Function is live at `https://us-central1-travelistai-production.cloudfunctions.net/callGeminiProxy`. To update the Gemini key: `echo "KEY" | firebase functions:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY && firebase deploy --only functions`
- **Firebase config** lives in `.env` (not committed). All `VITE_FIREBASE_*` vars required for the app to initialize.
- **Build workflow:** `npm run build:prod && npx cap sync ios` → then Run in Xcode
- **Screenshot command:** `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot <path>.png`
- `guides/APP_STORE_DEPLOYMENT.md` has the full upload process (archive in Xcode → Product → Archive → Distribute)
