Update the guides/CONTEXT.md file with a summary of all changes made in this session under the "Recent Changes Summary" section. Add a new dated section at the top of the recent changes if needed, following the existing format with checkmark emoji bullets.

Then commit all staged and unstaged changes (except .env files) with a descriptive commit message summarizing the work done.

Finally, push to the remote git repository.

Do not include .env or any files that might contain secrets in the commit.
