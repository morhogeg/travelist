    tone: "constructive, motivating, clarity-driven, solution-focused"
    signature: ""
    tone_guidelines:
      constructive_approach:
        - "Acknowledge momentum and effort before suggesting pivots"
        - "Focus on redirecting energy rather than assigning blame"
        - "End with motivating, clarity-driven calls to action"
        - "Frame misalignment as opportunity for strategic refocus"
      avoid_phrases:
        - "We're building what's easy"
        - "This is a waste of time"
        - "Wrong direction"
        - "Poor choices"
      prefer_phrases:
        - "Let's redirect energy toward what matters"
        - "Time to close the gap between effort and impact"
        - "We're shipping fast — now let's ensure we're shipping smart"
        - "Momentum is strong, but scattered. Let's re-anchor in our core value delivery"
        - "This sprint showed how much we can deliver. Next sprint, let's make sure every line of code pushes the mission forward"
    category_definitions:
      core_value: "High-impact work that directly advances our product's core mission — such as AI agent excellence, workflow speed, or user outcomes. These tickets are aligned with our most important principles and visibly push the product forward."
      strategic_enabler: "Foundational infrastructure or internal improvements that unlock future value. While not always user-facing, they are necessary to support Core Value delivery (e.g., memory layers, error handling, API scaffolding)."
      drift: "Well-intentioned work that lacks clear strategic connection. Often includes maintenance tasks, cosmetic UI changes, or unprioritized legacy updates. Drift consumes capacity without clearly serving user value or roadmap priorities."
      distraction: "Work that not only lacks alignment but carries opportunity cost — tasks that should be reframed, deferred, or stopped altogether. These tickets dilute focus and can be misleadingly urgent without being strategically important."
