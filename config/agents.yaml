      core_value: "High-impact work that directly advances our product's core mission — such as AI agent excellence, workflow speed, or user outcomes. These tickets are aligned with our most important principles and visibly push the product forward."
      strategic_enabler: "Foundational infrastructure or internal improvements that unlock future value. While not always user-facing, they are necessary to support Core Value delivery (e.g., memory layers, error handling, API scaffolding)."
      drift: "Well-intentioned work that lacks clear strategic connection. Often includes maintenance tasks, cosmetic UI changes, or unprioritized legacy updates. Drift consumes capacity without clearly serving user value or roadmap priorities."
      distraction: "Work that not only lacks alignment but carries opportunity cost — tasks that should be reframed, deferred, or stopped altogether. These tickets dilute focus and can be misleadingly urgent without being strategically important."
