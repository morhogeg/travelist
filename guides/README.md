## 💡 Quick Usage Guide

### For AI Assistants (Claude):
When starting a new session, user might say:
- "Check the guides folder and continue with X"
- "Read CONTEXT.md and implement Y"
- "Look at ROADMAP.md and pick the next priority"

**Recommended approach:**
1. Always start with `CONTEXT.md` for current state
2. Reference `IOS26_TRANSFORMATION.md` for design patterns
3. Check `ROADMAP.md` for feature priorities
4. Use `IOS_DEVELOPMENT.md` when dealing with iOS/Capacitor

### For Developers:
1. **New to project?** Read files in this order:
   - CONTEXT.md → IOS26_TRANSFORMATION.md → ROADMAP.md → IOS_DEVELOPMENT.md

2. **Continuing work?**
   - CONTEXT.md (get up to speed quickly)

3. **Implementing UI?**
   - IOS26_TRANSFORMATION.md (design system reference)

4. **Planning features?**
   - ROADMAP.md (see what's next)

5. **iOS issues?**
   - IOS_DEVELOPMENT.md (troubleshooting guide)
